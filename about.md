# The PAZL Workflow

PAZL is a DIY interior design platform which requires no prior design experience. Here is how it works
 
## Design Unlimited with Inspure
 
Upon logging into the app, users can effortlessly upload images of their homes.  Within our extensive collection, they can then choose their preferred design style. Once this selection is made, PAZL Inspire employs the power of Artificial Intelligence to instantaneously transform the user's space, aligning it with the chosen design style. Thanks to our innovative inpaint module within the AI engine, clients can also seamlessly position furniture and experiment with different colors in real-time, allowing them to fine-tune their vision and create the perfect moodboard for their dream home. Users have the freedom to regenerate and redesign their spaces until they are entirely satisfied with the results.
 

## The Modeller
 
After creating a moodboard, the next step involves the expert assistance of a PAZL certified Interior designer, who will work closely with users to craft a highly accurate and detailed design for their space. Powered by a comprehensive web application, Pazl's 3D modeler comes equipped with an extensive library of thousands of modular furniture modules perfectly suited for any home. Users can easily customize their furniture selections, utilizing real-time renders for immediate visualization, along with intelligent pricing determined by a proprietary material optimizer, ensuring optimal cost-effectiveness.
 

## Mixed Reality
 
PAZL introduces a groundbreaking approach to interior design, harnessing the power of Microsoft Holo Lens 2, a cutting-edge mixed reality device. Through this innovative technology, users can now visualize their spaces with unparalleled accuracy and immersion. By donning the Holo Lens 2, users can step into their empty space and witness the designed interior come to life, allowing them to walk around and interact with the virtual furniture. This transformative experience enables users to precisely visualize every aspect of their designed space. Moreover, with simple hand gestures and interactions, users can make real-time changes to the virtual environment, ensuring a seamless and dynamic design process that perfectly aligns with their vision.
 
## Your Dream Home
 
After the customer finalizes their design and expresses satisfaction, they can proceed to place their order. Within Pazl's marketplace, a curated selection of Pazl certified designers, engineers, manufacturers, and installers collaborates seamlessly to guarantee an exceptional outcome. This collaborative effort involves real-time site assessments, ensuring the design is precisely tailored to the specific conditions of the space. The detailed drawings produced by Pazl serve as the foundation for the manufacturing process, ensuring precision and accuracy. Thanks to this streamlined approach, customers can expect the delivery of high-quality home interiors within a remarkably efficient timeframe of 6-8 weeks.
