PAZL introduces a groundbreaking approach to interior design, harnessing the
power of Microsoft Holo Lens 2, a cutting-edge mixed reality device. Through
this innovative technology, users can now visualize their spaces with
unparalleled accuracy and immersion. By donning the Holo Lens 2, users can step
into their empty space and witness the designed interior come to life, allowing
them to walk around and interact with the virtual furniture. This
transformative experience enables users to precisely visualize every aspect of
their designed space. Moreover, with simple hand gestures and interactions,
users can make real-time changes to the virtual environment, ensuring a
seamless and dynamic design process that perfectly aligns with their vision.
